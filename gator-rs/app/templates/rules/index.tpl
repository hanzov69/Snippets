<h1>Rules</h1>

<h1>Primer</h1>

Robotskull is a loosely coded application, with few checks on data input apart from basic security filtering. Additionally, many components of the site intentionally allow any user to make global changes visible to all users. I know it is tempting to push the envelope on these things. It's fun to publicly mess with stuff, and that's why these features are included.

<p>

But if you go out of your way to damage the site or its data, or impair other users' ability to function normally, and I have to come in and clean up after you or restore something to its previous state, then that is so fucking it for you.

<p>

If my website is like a car that I built, and I have invited my friends to write on the hood of the car in washable markers, but you instead throw a gallon of paint on the upholstry, then my hate for you will be like an oppressive imperial regime, and your fate will be like an indiginous and naive island people.

<p>

Historically, users have done this by deliberately breaking page HTML or filling the database with junk. Of course, if it proves too easy to break stuff, and you manage to do it accidentally, then that is hardly your fault, is it. I am only addressing the h8rs.

<h1>Samn's irrational obsession with data integrity</h1>

<a name="data"></a>

I don't care how clever or creative you are. This isn't fucking MySpace. And moreover, I get unreasonably angsty when data is out of place, or tagged and filed and labeled and named incorrectly. I do my very best to be as tolerant as I can with anything you want to say or do on Robotskull, but this is one area where you will yield to my seemingly needless obsession with tidiness. Do not fill out your profile fields with bullshit answers. Leave it blank if you don't want to provide accurate data. Don't upload retarded pictures of bunnies in your profile pictures unless you are a bunny. There are plenty of opportunities to show off your wit, but I swear to god I will cut you if you mess up my neatly organized data.

<p>

I can't let it go and I don't want to let it go. I get boners from spreadsheets. It's a complex and it is unreasonable and silly, and most of the time I have to yield to the rest of the rational world, with their poorly organized data ways. When my friends give me MP3s with inconsistant ID3 tags, I deal with it. When I have to find a CD from the asset library at work, and the disks <b>aren't even numbered</b>, I deal with it. But in Robotskull, my sadistic fetish for data integrity can, and will, be the rule of law.
